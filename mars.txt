Dracula loves mars as it is dry and night all the time
Warewoolf not so much as it means he will be a warewolf all the time
Cold and dry everything is Draculas favourite colour
The two moons may be a problem for wolfman
The mummy will appreciate a lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
The really ill-considered change
